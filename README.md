# Firefly Ï‡

![CURE LOGO](other/media/newlogo.png)

A Python implementation of similar-functioning avionics code designed to be
run on the avionics bay. Originally designed for the 2019-2020 Clemson
University Rocket Engineering year.

This software suite is designed to work with a Raspberry Pi and Sense-Hat
with other specific components specified in the 
[documentation](other/documentation/README.md).

This is the 21st century. Batteries are cheap. So are computers. We can afford
to run a linux kernel on a rocket. The goals of this system are to 
1. **Be reusable**. We don't want to have to rewrite the codebase for different
microprocessors or components. 
2. **Be modular**. Both so multiple people can maintain different components of
the software and so each is easily understood and independent. 
3. **Be easy**. Everyone who's written hello world should be able to read the
higher-order files and understand what they actually do. This also implies 
_documentation_.

### Current Status
